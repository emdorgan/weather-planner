# Weather Dashboard

This project uses server-side APIs to get the latest up-to-date weather in any city around the world. The user can search for a city and see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index along with a 5 day forecast. The previous 8 searches show up in the sidebar 

## To Do list

* Set up for loop for 5 day forecast
* Make the button with event listener that takes data and sets it to searchedCity variable
* Make it so that a new button is generated in the search history for the past 8 cities searched
