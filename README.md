# Weather Dashboard

This project uses server-side APIs to get the latest up-to-date weather in any city around the world. The user can search for a city and see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index along with a 5 day forecast. This search along with previous searches show up in the sidebar. These past searches persist between page reload (max 15).
